ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Aethelind! <!-- (ETHâ€”lind) -->

I'm a semicolon enthusiast with a Computer Science degree from uOttawa. I'm curious about all facets of backend development, and keen to learn more and expand my tech stack. I love when I can use my skills and passion to make a real impact.

<!-- Beyond tech, most weekends you can find me diving into genealogy ([are we cousins?](https://www.ancestry.ca/account/profile/08031f88-0006-0000-0000-000000000000)). -->
