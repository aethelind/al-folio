title: 📍 Shuttle Tracker
description: >
    Created proof-of-concept for a cheap, reliable, scalable tracking system for the campus shuttle. The shuttle's location and projected arrival times are delivered to commuters.
stack: Ionic, Angular, Typescript, Firebase.

Full stack developer: designed a system to help hundreds of daily commuters plan their trips by tracking the current location of the campus shuttle busses using real-time GPS data, and displaying live bus arrival times. 

Developed an application stack consisting of two cross-platform mobile applications linked to Google Maps’ API; an interactive front-end displaying the current shuttle location and live arrival estimates; and a NoSQL, Cloud database hosted on Firebase.

The apps were developed using Ionic Framework combined with JavaScript, SCSS, TypeScript, and Angular JS to create a smooth and intuitive UI. 

The below video showcases the two mobile apps and their interactions with the database.

Before development, I defined system and user requirements by communicating with stakeholders and conducting user surveys. As well, I participated in weekly Scrums with my project supervisor to ensure a consistent development pace. 

I embraced new approaches to mobile development and acquired new skill sets in order to develop and maintain the system within the project’s budget and deadlines. During the project, I lowered costs by optimizing mandatory calls to Google Maps API, reducing total API calls by 80%. 

Ensured security, usability, and scalability of the system through prototyping, continuous integration, and performance monitoring.
