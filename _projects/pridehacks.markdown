This project was done for the [2021 QueerTech PrideHacks hackathon](https://www.queertech.org/pridehacks).

The non-profit I collaborated with was [ODLAN (Ontario Digital Literacy and Access Network)](https://www.odlan.ca/). ODLAN has aspirations of developing a digital device gifting program, including collection, refurbishment, and distribution of devices such as smart phones and tablets. Once this tech is shared with the community, ODLAN wants to ensure that recipients have access to tech support when they need it. The overall vision of this program is a "Device Gifting Ecosystem."

Over the course of the hackathon, my team collaborated to create workflows for the various users who may interact with the ecosystem. We developed the sitemap for the device gifting program, and created UI mockups for these webpages.
