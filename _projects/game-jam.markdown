title: ðŸ•¹ Cartridge Game Jam
description: >
    "Make a real game based on a fake cartridge!" <br>I chose to create a game based on "Bus Line 22A, Destination: The Moon."
    I used the open source game engine Godot and wrote the game using GDScript, Godot's own language which is similar to Python.

stack: Godot, GDScript
